```
### Your answer here
If trunk-based development is selected in scenario three, it impacts the project as follows:

Collaboration: Trunk-based development promotes a single shared branch where all developers work, making it easier for team members to collaborate. However, it requires extra effort in coordinating work and addressing potential merge conflicts due to simultaneous development.

Continuous Integration: This branching strategy encourages developers to commit their code to the shared trunk regularly, leading to faster feedback and issue detection. The development process becomes more streamlined, allowing for quicker integration of code changes.

Deployment and Releases: Trunk-based development emphasizes frequent releases and quicker delivery of new features and bug fixes. However, the lack of separate branches for stable and development versions could lead to decreased stability in the production environment.

Code Stability and Testing: With all developers working on the same branch, there's a risk of introducing unstable code, which may require additional testing and validation efforts before deployment.

In summary, selecting trunk-based development in scenario 3 can lead to improved collaboration, continuous integration, and faster releases. However, it also comes with challenges in managing simultaneous work, ensuring production stability, and coordinating work among team members.
